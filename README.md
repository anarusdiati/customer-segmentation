# Turning Marketing Data into Actionable Insights

Customer Segmentation Analysis Using K-Means

<h1>Overview</h1>

This project applies unsupervised learning to segment customers from a marketing campaign dataset based on demographic and behavioral attributes such as age, income, and product spending patterns.

The goal is to uncover meaningful customer groups that support personalized marketing strategies and data-driven decision-making.

<h1>Problem</h1>

Marketing campaigns often treat customers as a single group, leading to inefficient targeting. This project explores: How can customer behavior be segmented to better understand purchasing preferences?

<h1>Approach</h1>

- Selected key demographic and spending features
- Standardized numerical data for fair clustering
- Applied K-Means clustering
- Evaluated cluster quality using: Elbow Method, Silhouette Score

<h1>Customer Segments</h1>

**Cluster 0 : Budget-Conscious Buyers**

Lower income consumers with spending focused on essential and affordable products.

**Cluster 1 : Affluent Premium-Oriented Seniors**

Older, higher-income customers with strong spending on premium products such as wine and meat.

**Cluster 2 : High-Income Lifestyle Consumers**

Highly affluent customers with very high spending on premium and quality-focused products.

<h1>Tech Stack</h1>

- Language: Python
- ML: Scikit-learn
- Data: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

<h1>Key Insight</h1>

Clustering reveals distinct customer behaviors that enable targeted marketing, improved product positioning, and more effective customer engagement.
